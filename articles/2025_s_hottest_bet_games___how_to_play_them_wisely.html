<p><strong>Blockchain-Based Prediction Markets</strong>  
Decentralized platforms are revolutionizing prediction betting, enabling wagers on everything from crypto trends to climate outcomes. These markets use smart contracts for payouts, reducing reliance on intermediaries. To succeed, diversify predictions across low-risk events (e.g., sports outcomes) and high-reward niches (e.g., tech innovations). Always verify the platform’s liquidity and reputation before depositing funds.</p>
