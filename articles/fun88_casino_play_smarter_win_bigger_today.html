Avoid chasing losses, as this can lead to impulsive decisions and deplete your funds quickly. Set win and loss limits for each session and adhere to them strictly. Remember, gambling should be a form of entertainment, not a source of financial stress. Only gamble with what you can afford to lose, and never borrow money to gamble.</p>
